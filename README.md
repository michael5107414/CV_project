# Computer Vision Project for Frame Interpolation
This is the project content of frame interpolation. Now we are implementing the paper [Softmax Splatting for Video Frame Interpolation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Niklaus_Softmax_Splatting_for_Video_Frame_Interpolation_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) [1]. We'll try various techniques to improve the quality of output frames.

## setup
The following packages need to be installed:

`pip install cupy-cuda101` if your cuda version is v10.1, please use the version corresponding to your cuda version

`pip install opencv-contrib-python`

`pip install torch`

`pip install tensorflow` if version is higher than 1.15, it may fails.

## usage
Before generating frames, you need to check whether the flow files exist. If not, you can `cd PWCNet`, and then execute `python predict.py --task type_of_task`. After that, the frames are generated by execute `python main.py --task type_of_task`. Finally, you can simply execute `bash eval.sh` to check the quality of generated frames.
