# softmax-splatting
This is a reference implementation of the softmax splatting operator, which has been proposed in Softmax Splatting for Video Frame Interpolation [1], using PyTorch. Softmax splatting is a well-motivated approach for differentiable forward warping. It uses a translational invariant importance metric to disambiguate cases where multiple source pixels map to the same target pixel. Should you be making use of our work, please cite our paper [1].

## setup
The softmax splatting is implemented in CUDA using CuPy, which is why CuPy is a required dependency. It can be installed using `pip install cupy` or alternatively using one of the provided [binary packages](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy) as outlined in the CuPy repository.

The provided example script is using OpenCV to load and display images, as well as to read the provided optical flow file. An easy way to install OpenCV for Python is using the `pip install opencv-contrib-python` package.

## usage
We provide a small script to replicate the third figure of our paper [1]. You can simply run `python run.py` to obtain the comparison between summation splatting, average splatting, linear splatting, and softmax splatting. Please see this exemplatory `run.py` for additional information on how to use the provided reference implementation of our proposed softmax splatting operator for differentiable forward warping.

## xiph
In our paper, we propose to use 4K video clips from Xiph to evaluate video frame interpolation on high-resolution footage. Please see the supplementary `benchmark.py` on how to reproduce the shown metrics.
